# Components Overview

This document outlines the components that make up the repository. Each component is designed with a single responsibility to ensure modularity and maintainability. The components are implemented as independent modules, allowing them to remain decoupled from one another.

## Example Component Definitions

Below are example component definitions for this template repository:


### 1. Calculator

**Description:**  
The Calculator component performs arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication. 

**Responsibilities:**
- **Arithmetic Operations:** Execute addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
- **Result Validation:** Ensure the correctness of operations before passing results to other components.

---

### 2. Logger

**Description:**  
The Logger component records each operation performed by the Calculator. It serves as the audit trail for all arithmetic operations, ensuring that the operations and their outcomes are persistently logged.

**Responsibilities:**
- **Operation Recording:** Capture details of every calculation including operands, operator, and result.
- **Data Persistence:** Optionally store logs for future reference or debugging.
---

### 3. Notifier

**Description:**  
The Notifier component sends alerts when a calculation result exceeds a predefined threshold. This component ensures that important outcomes are highlighted, enabling timely responses when critical values are encountered.

**Responsibilities:**
- **Threshold Monitoring:** Compare calculation results against a preset threshold.
- **Alerting:** Send notifications when results exceed the threshold.
---

### Component Interaction

 **Calculation Process:**  
   - The **Calculator** performs an arithmetic operation.
   - The result is passed to the **Logger** to record the details.
   - If the result exceeds the predefined threshold, the **Notifier** is triggered to send an alert.
